            <p>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is a markup language for the web that defines the structure of web pages.

                It is one of the most basic building blocks of every website, so it's crucial to learn if you want to have a career in web development.
                
                In this article, I will walk you through what HTML is about in detail, how it does things on web pages, and we'll also touch on a really cool part of HTML Semantic HTML.

                <div class="col-4">
                    <div class="head"> 
                        <i class="fa-brands fa-html5"></i>
                        <h1>What Is HTML?</h1>
                    </div>
                    <p>To understand "HTML" from front to back, let's look at each word that makes up the abbreviation:

                        Hypertext: text (often with embeds such as images, too) that is organized in order to connect related items
                        
                        Markup: a style guide for typesetting anything to be printed in hardcopy or soft copy format
                        
                        <br><br> Language: <br><br> a language that a computer system understands and uses to interpret commands.
                        
                        HTML determines the structure of web pages. This structure alone is not enough to make a web page look good and interactive. So you'll use assisted technologies such as CSS and JavaScript to make your HTML beautiful and add interactivity, respectively.
                        
                        In this case, I like to break down the three technologies – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – this way: they are like a human body.</p>
